No matter the size, all computers have four basic functions: input, processing, output, and storage.
Input
Inputs are information received by a computer. A computer cannot perform a function until it receives input. 
Web developers build interfaces for users to provide input through keyboards, computer mouses, or even touchscreens and microphones. 
Computers can also receive input automatically through devices like sensors.  
The computer must translate the data it receives from the input devices into binary code for the computer to either store or process. 
Binary code, also known as machine code, is a system that represents all data as either 0’s or 1’s (or false/true or off/on). 
It is the only language that a computer can understand.  

Processing
When a computer receives data, in the form of 0’s and 1’s, it must transform that data. The computer transforms the data into anything 
from numbers, to letters, to simple commands. Processing is the series of actions that a computer takes when it receives data. The programs 
that web developers write will tell the computer what to do with the data that it receives. The computer mainly performs logical operations 
because the data is converted into 0’s and 1’s.  

Output
Output is the result of the computer transforming input data, through processing, into usable information. A computer’s output might be letters, 
numbers, photos, videos, or audio. Users can receive this output in different ways including via device screens, speakers, and even external 
devices such as printers. Similarly to input devices, output devices must do some translation. They decode machine code from the computer into a
format that users can understand. 

Storage
Storage refers to how a device retains information. Web developers need to be aware of, and need to know how to use, short-term storage and 
long-term storage.  
Short-term storage, also called volatile memory, stores data while the device is running. Websites store data that web pages will use while the 
user is interacting with it. The data is stored in short-term memory, called random access memory (RAM). For example, suppose you’re developing a 
site that handles inventory for a shipping firm. When a customer enters an order, the web page will hold the data in short-term memory until the 
customer clicks or taps a button to submit the order. In many cases, the web browser will handle storing data in short-term memory. 
Long-term storage will retain information even after the device is powered down. Devices like solid-state drives (SDD) or hard disk drives (HDD) 
are used for long-term storage. Websites create small files that store information called cookies. A cookie stores user-specific data such as the 
last time that the user visited the site, how long before they need to log in again, and other data. The device’s long term storage stores cookies, 
which persist between site sessions. A session is the time a user is on a website in one continuous block of time. 

Hardware
Hardware is the physical components your computer needs to operate. Examples of hardware include the RAM and central processing unit (CPU), which handles processing. 
Some hardware also functions as input/output (I/O) devices. I/O devices are the physical components your computer needs to gather inputs and share outputs. The keyboard,
microphone, and mouse are examples of I/O devices.

Software
The primary software that your computer needs is an operating system (OS). The operating system is like a manager. It enables you to communicate with the computer without 
knowing machine code. It also manages all software and hardware, and acts as a coordinator between the hardware and all systems that are running. Some examples of operating 
systems are Linux, Windows, Android, Apple macOS, and Apple iOS.  
Other software applications, also called programs, are sets of instructions that the computer uses to perform tasks that are beyond the main functions of the operating system. 
Examples of software applications include web browsers, word processors, and image editors.  

Web Browser
The web browser is like the automobile. It has a lot of power and uses complex software to make the web useful. However, without websites, it really can’t do much. The web 
sites and web applications that developers write are like the driver—they tell the browser what to do to make it useful.
Web applications are a hybrid between a software program and a web page. Web applications can run in a browser, but many software developers use a wrapper for web apps. A 
wrapper is software into which a developer can add the code they developed for a website. You might have downloaded an app onto your phone that looks and behaves just like 
the application's website, such as a to-do list app. The phone app has essentially the same code as the website, but it is delivered and operates on your phone through a wrapper.
